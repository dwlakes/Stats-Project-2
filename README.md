# Stats-Project-2

Math 200 ‚Äì Project 2
This project will cover topics from chapters 7 through 10 of your textbook. All
papers will need to be submitted in IvyLearn.
You will be performing an analysis on adult female heights. A dataset that contains
a random sample of 30 heights is provided. For purposes of this analysis, assume
average height of women is 65 inches with a standard deviation of 3.5 inches. You
will need this information for parts of your analysis.
You will be turning in a paper that should include section headings, graphics and
tables when appropriate and complete sentences which explain all analysis,
conclusions, and results. There is not a specified length, however it is important
that you follow all steps below and grade yourself using the rubric provided since it
is the rubric that will be used to grade your submissions. All work should be your
own. Plagiarism will result in a project score of 0.
Steps (all statistical analysis to be done in Excel and/or StatCrunch):
1. Download the Project 2 Excel data from IvyLearn
2. Find the tallest person from the data and using the population mean and
standard deviation given above, calculate:
a. The z-score for this tallest person and its interpretation
b. The probability that a randomly selected female is taller than she
c. The probability that a randomly selected female is shorter than she
d. Is her height ‚Äúunusual‚Äù
3. Find the shortest person from the data and using the population mean and
standard deviation given above, calculate:
e. The z-score for this shortest person and its interpretation
f. The probability that a randomly selected female is taller than she
g. The probability that a randomly selected female is shorter than she
h. Is her height ‚Äúunusual‚Äù
4. Describe the sampling distribution of the mean with this sample size.
5. Create a Boxplot and determine whether there are any outliers in the dataset.
6. Use the data to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average heights of
woman. Hint: you can use the ‚Äúwith data‚Äù option in StatCrunch to do this
calculation. Interpret your interval estimate. Does the data support what you
were told the population mean is?
7. Female volleyball players are reported to be 67 inches in height on average.
Use the results from your confidence interval to test whether female
volleyball players are unusually tall. Explain.
8. Female soccer players are reported to be 63.7 inches in height on average.
Use the data in the Excel file to test whether women are typically
significantly taller than the average soccer player. Conduct a hypothesis test
at the ùõº = 0.05 level of significance. State your hypotheses; state your test

statistic; and give the p-value and conclusions using proper language. Again,
you can use the ‚Äúwith data‚Äù option in StatCrunch.
9. Put everything together into an organized paper and submit on IvyLearn.
